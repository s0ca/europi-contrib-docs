## Why this site exists

The EuroPi contrib scripts are an amazing resource.

Over time, a large number of community scripts have been added to the official
EuroPi repository under `software/contrib`, covering a wide range of musical
ideas, utilities, experiments, and educational examples.

However, browsing this documentation directly from GitHub can become a bit
cumbersome:
- Markdown files are spread across a large directory
- Discoverability is limited
- Searching across scripts is not always convenient
- Reading long docs and code side-by-side is not very comfortable

This site exists to solve **only that problem**.

---

## What this site is

- A **read-only, user-friendly documentation website**
- Automatically synced from the **official EuroPi repository**
- Focused on **reading, browsing and searching** contrib scripts
- Always generated from upstream content — no manual edits here

Nothing more, nothing less 

---

## What this site is NOT

-  Not a fork of EuroPi
-  Not a replacement for the official documentation
-  Not a new contribution workflow
-  Not a place where scripts should be submitted

All contributions **must continue to go to the official EuroPi repository**.

## How updates work

This site is generated automatically from the upstream EuroPi repository:
- Markdown documentation is synced as-is
- Python scripts are rendered into readable code pages
- New scripts appear automatically when they are merged upstream
- No extra work is required from contributors

If it’s in the official repo, it will appear here.
